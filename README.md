# Nekos4J

This is a rewrite of the original [Nekos4J](https://github.com/Nekos-life/Nekos4J),
so that it feels nicer and whatever.
I just made this because I was bored.

# Adding to your project

Since the original author has removed it from bintray,
 and I have yet to get around to adding it to a maven repository,
 you can only add it through github.
 
 For now, you must go to the "releases" tab on github and download it there.
 Or, you could `git clone https://github.com/solonovamax/Nekos4J.git`,
 then `gradlew jar javadocJar sourcesJar`.
 The build files will be in `./build/libs/`.


# Contributing

Just open a pull request, or some shit and maybe I'll add it.
